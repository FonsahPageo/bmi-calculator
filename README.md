# BMI Calculator

This simple app helps users calculate their **BMI** (Body Mass Index).

## What is BMI?

BMI is a calculation of body fat based on your height and weight, to help screen for potential health risks associated with being underweight, overweight or obese.

## How is it calculated?

A standard formular divides your **weight** in kilograms by your **height** squared in meters to get a BMI number, which is then compared to categories.

## BMI Categories (Adults)

- Underweight: BMI below 18.5
- Healthy weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9
- Overweight: BMI between 25.0 and 29.9
- Obese weight: BMI above 30.0

## Why is it used?

- BMI is a quick and simple way to determine if your weight is within a healthy range for your height. 
- Though a very useful tool, it doesn't account for muscle mass, bone density or body fat distrubution therfore should be used alongside other health factors and professional medical advice.

## Health Risk Assessment

A higher BMI is often associated with an increased risk of health problems, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. 

## Limitations of BMI

### Doesn't measure body fat directly
- BMI uses height and weight, not direct measurements of body fat, so it doesn't account for muscle, bone density, or overall body composition. 

### Not accurate for everyone

- BMI may be less accurate for very muscular individuals or specific ethnic groups, and it doesn't show where fat is stored in the body. 

### Requires Context:
- BMI should be considered alongside other health indicators, such as waist circumference and blood pressure, for a complete health assessment.

## What to do next?

### Consult a Healthcare Provider:

- If you have concerns about your BMI or weight, speak with your doctor or a dietitian for professional advice
